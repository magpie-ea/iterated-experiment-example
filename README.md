Demo of iterated experiments with \_babe.

The example corresponds to the experiment with ID 49 on https://babe-demo.herokuapp.com

First, clone the repo and run `npm install` in the folder.

Under the new server structure for complex experiments, each participant is assigned a trituple `<variant-nr, chain-nr, realization-nr>`. Those numbers increase in the order of:

1. `variant-nr`
2. `chain-nr`
3. `realization-nr`

In this experiment, there is one variant, three chains, and 20 realizations for each chain.

Each time you open `index.html` in your browser, you will join the experiment as a new participant.

The participant `<variant-nr, chain-nr, realization-nr + 1>` waits on the results of the participant `<variant-nr, chain-nr, realization-nr>`.

Therefore, assuming nobody submitted any results yet, the fourth tab you open should have you wait in the lobby, until you submit the result in the first tab, by which time the results will be shown to the fourth participant.

For demonstration sake, the trituple for each participant is explicitly displayed at the trial view.
